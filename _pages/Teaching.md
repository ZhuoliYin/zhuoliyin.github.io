Growing up in a family of teachers, I bring a strong and distinctive record of teaching and educational innovation during my PhD journey. In particular, I have extensive experience in *IE343 ‚Äî Engineering Economics*, serving in both lecturing and teaching assistant roles across **ten** semesters as of Fall 2025.

## Instructor

### IE343 Engineering Economics, Purdue University, Fall 2023
- Enrollment: 150 undergraduate students from 10 different engineering disciplines
- Overall evaluation score: 4.5/5.0
- Fully responsible for the class, and supervised two teaching assistants and two graders.

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in [Industrial Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE) at Purdue University, working with [Prof. Hua Cai](https://engineering.purdue.edu/uSMART) in the uSMART group. My advisory committee includes [Prof. Stephan Biller](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=273149), [Prof. Young-Jun Son](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=270111), [Prof. Reem Khir](https://sites.google.com/view/reemkhir), and [Prof. Yi Ding](https://y-ding.github.io/).

Previously, I earned my MS (2021) in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University advised by Prof. Hua Cai; and I obtained my BE (2019) in Electronic and Information Engineering from Beihang University advised by [Prof. Xiaoqian Sun and Prof. Sebastian Wandelt](https://www.m3nets.de/). I also worked with [Dr. Massimiliano Zanin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NrcrF-cAAAAJ&hl=es&inst=5549692440350501774) as an undergraduate researcher at Polytechnic University of Madrid from 02/2019 to 05/2019.

My research interest focuses on fusing AI/ML and operations research (OR) to tackle planning and operational challenges and to advance sustainability in urban mobility and logistics systems. During my PhD study, I have gained full-lifecycle experience in both **Generative AI** and **Machine Learning** system design and deployment, spanning shared mobility rebalancing, resilient network design, automatic life-cycle assessment, and intelligent tutoring systems.

Decision-making occurs every day across domains, from logistics and transportation to energy, to make the most of our resources. 
The advancement of AI/ML has provided unprecedented opportunity to **augment**â€”not replaceâ€”classical operations research (OR), enabling data-driven forecasting, scheduling, optimization, and sequential decision-making. 
My research aims to integrate AI/ML and OR to design both efficient and sustainable decision-making pipelines, for practitioners to deploy and generalize intelligent decision systems at scale. 
I am particularly interested in **applied AI** for urban mobility and logistics systems, identifying their sustainability opportunities while maintain service efficiency. 

I am currently focusing on three key areas: 
1. fusing generative AI and OR to transform combinatorial optimization;
2. optimizing the on-demand operation of shared mobility systems;
3. evaluating life-cycle carbon footprint of AI systems.
